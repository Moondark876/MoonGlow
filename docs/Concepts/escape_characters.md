# Escape Characters in MoonGlow

Escape characters in MoonGlow would be an excellent addition. It would help users to perform complex operations within strings with little to no effort.

Below are some examples of those of which I plan on implementing:

```
newline = '\n'
tab = '\t'
backspace = '\b'
```
