# Functions in MoonGlow

In this section, we will learn how to use functions in MoonGlow.
MoonGlow has functions, which are used to execute a block of code which will most likely be used repetitively. Functions are written like this:

```MoonGlow
func name(arguments) -> {
    -- Code to execute
}
```

A function can take up to 255 arguments, which are separated by commas. The arguments are called parameters. The arguments are passed to the function when the function is called.

```MoonGlow
func name(arguments) -> {
    -- Code to execute
}

name("name here");
```
