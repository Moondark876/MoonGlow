# If Statements in MoonGlow

If statements in MoonGlow can be defined in 1 line, or in multiple depending on the level of readability you want. Both types of if statements follow the same format, `if (condition) -> {action}`. Consider the example below:

```MoonGlow
if (true) -> out "yes";
```

The above in expanded format would be:

```MoonGlow
if (true) -> {
    out "yes";
}
```

If statements in MoonGlow support `and` and `or` operators. An example of their usage is below:

```MoonGlow
-- Not implemented yet
```
