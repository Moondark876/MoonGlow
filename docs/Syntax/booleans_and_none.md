# Boolean and Nonetype values in MoonGlow

In this section, we will learn how to use booleans and None in MoonGlow.
There isnt much to say about booleans. Booleans are true or false operations that tell if a condition is an event or not. Here are the two boolean keywords:

```MoonGlow
true -- Truthy Boolean Keyword
false -- Falsey Boolean Keyword
```

Also, there is none. None is the keyword used to denote the inexistence of a value. It is the default return value of a function. In MoonGlow, it looks like this:

```MoonGlow
none -- Null Value Keyword
```
