# While loops in MoonGlow

In this section, we will learn how to use while loops in MoonGlow.
MoonGlow has a while loop, which is a loop that executes a block of code until a certain condition is met. The while loop is written like this:

```MoonGlow
while (-/condition/-) -> {
    -- Code to execute until condition is met
}
```

While loops in MoonGlow are very similar to the while loops in C/C++. The only difference is that MoonGlow uses the `(condition) ->` syntax instead of the `(condition)` syntax in those languages.
